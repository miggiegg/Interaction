		<div>Exploring objects has never been more interactive on a device. With 3D models, readers are able to rotate and manipulate objects freely and intuitively with simple gestures. This innovative feature creates a rich and intuitive experience. 


Vanadium Press uses high frame rate scanning cameras to transform real objects into beautiful, high-resolution 3D models. For digital models, we team with experts to create solid or shell models using polygonal and curve methods.

</div>
		<div>As additional studying tools, custom-designed quizzes and integrated flashcards also help readers increase learning retention and mastery of new concepts.

		<div>With integrated audio and video, users not only read content, but also hear and watch it. Whether an audio clip of a historic speech or a video timelapse of a plant’s lifecycle, these effects add a new dimension to reading and learning. 

Audio and video can be embedded for online or offline use. With custom HTML, large files can be streamed through the internet to minimize file space on devices. Smaller audio and video files can be implemented right within the pages for offline viewing. 
We source audio and video that are in the public domain or are royalty-free to save on costs associated with recording or filming new material. For projects that have specialized audio and video, we partner with other content creators to deliver high-quality content.
