		<div>Standard on most digital platforms that Vanadium Press publishes on, integrated highlighting and annotating tools help readers mark important points and write down thoughts. 


</div>
		<div>Small animations, such as pop-over widgets and scrollable modules, add a little fun and interactivity to the reading. Custom animations, such as the one shown here, enhance storytelling to new levels.

		<div>Exploring objects has never been more interactive on a device. With 3D models, readers are able to rotate and manipulate objects freely and intuitively with simple gestures. This innovative feature creates a rich and intuitive visual experience. 


Vanadium Press uses high frame rate scanning cameras to transform real objects into beautiful, high-resolution 3D models. For digital models, we team with experts to create solid or shell models using polygonal and curve methods.

</div>
		<div>As additional studying tools, custom-designed quizzes and integrated flashcards also help readers increase learning retention and master new concepts.

		<div>Something as simple as the page color and typeface of a publication can drastically enhance a reader’s experience. Vanadium Press publishes on platforms that give readers the option to change these user experience elements.

		<div>With integrated audio and video, users not only read content, but also hear and watch. Whether an audio clip of a historic speech or a video timelapse of a plant’s lifecycle, these additions add a whole new level of interactivity to reading and learning. 

Audio and video can be embedded for online or offline usage. With custom HTML, large files can be streamed with internet access to minimize file space. Other audio and video with smaller file sizes can be implemented right within the pages for offline viewing. 
Vanadium Press sources audio and video that are in the public domain or are royalty-free to save costs associated with recording or filming new material. With projects with specialized audio and video needs, we partner with other content creators to deliver high-quality content.
